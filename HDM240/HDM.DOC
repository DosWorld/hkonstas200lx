         HDM 2.4 DOS APPLICATION MANAGER      (May 25/98)
----------------------------------------------------------------

_______________
I.Introduction.


 HDM is a DOS application manager which has the same
graphical user interface as the built-in Application
Manager of the HP200LX. HDM can also run in DOS, and can
handle up to 120 applications. You can specify the zoom
mode, screen, serial port state, command line arguments
and icon for every application installed. It also has
some built-in utilities, such as battery setup & status,
volume control, & system information screen.


What's new in Vr.2.4b
---------------------

 * IMPORTANT: The DOSMGR.DAT file format has been changed!!!
              Because of this, you need to run the HDMCNV
              utility so you won't need to re-enter your
              application data in HDM.

              Please run the included HDMCNV conversion
              utility ones before installing this new
              version of HDM!!!! The original DOSMGR.DAT
              file will be renamed to DOSMGR.BAK.

              If you have several DOSMGR.DAT files that need
              to be converted, you can specify the name of
              the .DAT file at the HDMCNV command line,

               e.g.:    hdmcnv myfile.dat

              and it will be converted to the new format.
              The original file will be renamed: dosmgr.bak
              When no .DAT file is specified, the default
              c:\_dat\dosmgr.dat file will be converted.


 + You can now browse for a file when launching an
   application with additional arguments (F8). You
   can also use F8 repeatedly to select multiple files
   for the arguments list.

 + Changed the hotkey character of the icon extraction
   menu option (had the same hotkey as "Exit").

 + The icon extraction feature now creates .ICN filenames
   using the application names.

 + Topcard is not shown by default.

 + Added a help (tip) entry for each application. This enables
   the user to attach tips or help information (up to 80
   characters long) to an application, which will be displayed
   just before the application is launched.



Installation:
-------------

 If you are upgrading from a previous version of HDM, please
run the HDMCNV conversion utility (included in this ZIP)
before you install this new version of HDM! The conversion
utility will convert all your application data stored into
the c:\_dat\dosmgr.dat file so you won't need to re-enter
them.


 If you plan to use HDM from within System Manager there's
an icon supplied for this. What I did is installed HDM
as a new application to the System manager, and moved its
icon to the top left corner of the screen (first icon).

                    !!IMPORTANT!!:
To install HDM as an application in the System Manager,
add the '|' character at the end of the filename so that
System Manager launches HDM with the maximum possible memory.
HDM needs AT LEAST 100k of free memory!

For example, if DM.EXE resides in A:\HDM, you should
enter the following line:

 a:\hdm\dm.exe|        < notice the '|' character!

 You can use HDM from both Application manager and DOS.

 With the growing number of PAL applications that are having the
same look & feel of the built-in applications, HDM will be
very usefull.


 Here are the contents of the HDM.ZIP file:

 HDMCNV.EXE:  IMPORTANT!!! Run this first if you are
              upgrading from a previous version of HDM.

 DEMO.BAT:    Demo batch file. This will give you a quick idea
              on what HDM is all about.

 DEMO.DAT:    Demo application list data-file.

 DM.EXE:      The HDM launcher written by Rob Koenis.
 HDM.EXE:     The HDM executable. Must run DM.EXE to run it.
 DM.ICN:      The HDM Icon.
 HDM.DOC:     This document file.

 ICONS.ZIP:   A small collection of icons you can add to your
              icon directory. If you don't have an icon
              directory you should create one for HDM.

 > Files created by HDM:

 DOSMGR.ENV : This file will be created in your C:\_DAT
              directory. It will hold information such
              as the Icon directory path, the current
              cursor position, and all of the topcard info.

 DOSMGR.DAT : This file will be created in your C:\_DAT
              directory. It will have the list of all the
              installed applications and icons. Make sure
              to make a backup of both files when you are
              done with your application installation.


 DM.EXE and HDM.EXE  are the only files needed to run HDM,
but they MUST reside in the same directory.

 * Make sure to edit your path statement in your AUTOEXEC.BAT
   file, to include the HDM directory. This is needed so that
   HDM can be loaded back when a launched application has
   terminated.


_________________
II. Instructions.

 HDM is quite easy to use. You are probably familiar with the
built-in Application Manager of your LX. HDM operates very
much in the same manner. Note that you must run DM.EXE in order
to use HDM.

 HDM uses about 100k of memory when running, but releases
all memory that it occupies when launching an application.
Only 3760 bytes are used by the COMMAND.COM and DM.EXE when
an application is launched.

 You can specify your own DOSMGR.DAT file if you wish when
running HDM. The command line arguments are:

 dm <appfile>

 where <appfile> is the name of a valid application-list file.
This option allows you to use different menu setups. If you
If the <appfile> isn't a valid DOSMGR.DAT file, HDM will
run without loading it.

 The first time you will launch DM, you will see the familiar
TOPCARD picture appear on the screen. You can press any
key to see the application list. Pressing the [ESC] key will
quit HDM.

 You can specify the topcard filename in the [MENU][Setup]
[Owner] menu. You can also enter your name, title, and
company name that will be displayed at the center of the
topcard screen.


                << NOTE FOR SPEEDY LOADING >>

IMPORTANT: If you would like to speed-up the loading of HDM,
           you can disable the TOPCARD feature in the SETUP
           menu. Press [MENU] [Setup] [Owner] and clear
           the "Show Picture" checkbox. This will make
           the loading of HDM much faster.


 ******************** OPERATION KEYS **************************

 Here's a brief summary of the keys:

 F1 = Quick Help screen.
 F2 = Add a DOS application.
 F3 = Edit a DOS application.
 F4 = Delete a DOS application.
 F5 = Open (execute) a DOS application.
 F6 = Open (execute) a DOS applications but prompt for
      extra command line arguments, or file browsing.

 F7 = Change application Order. Pressing F7 will display
      the selected application in "negative". You can then
      use the arrows to the desired new position of the
      application, and press F10 or ENTER to change
      its position. The application from the previous
      position will be swapped with the one on the
      new position.

 F8 = Show topcard. NOTE: This feature works ONLY if HDM
      was LOADED with the topcard-display feature enabled
      from the SETUP menu. The reason for this is that
      when the topcard feature is enabled, HDM loads it
      and keeps it in memory, so it can be displayed
      faster. If you enable the topcard-display feature,
      YOU MUST quit HDM and run it again so it can be
      loaded in memory.

 F9 = Page up (same as the PG UP key).
 F10= Page down (same as the PG DN key).

 [SPACE]  = Displays some system information.
 [HOME]   = Brings you to the first application.
 [ENTER]  = Executes the selected application (same as F5).
 [DEL]    = Removes the selected application from HPMENU.
 [arrows] = Use them to select an application.
 [MENU]   = Opens the menu.
 [ESC]    = Quits HDM.
 [ZOOM]   = Pressing Fn-SPACE 'zooms' the application names.

 ICON SORT= You have to go through the menu for this. Press
            [MENU][A][S] and you will be prompted if you
            want HDM to sort your icons by name. Press F10
            to do so.


 ICON EXTRACTION:
            This menu option will extract a selected icon
            from HDM into a c:\appname.icn file, where
            appname is the name of the application.


 YES/NO BOXES:

            When HDM pops up with a YES/NO confirmation box,
            you can press the ALT-Y, ALT-N key combinations,
            as well F9/ESC for 'no' and F10 for 'yes'.


 ***************** PREDEFINED BUILT-IN HOTKEYS *******************

 You can use the following key combinations to launch any
 of the 24 displayed applications:

 CTRL-F1 to CTRL-F8   = Hotkeys for the first row of applications.
 SHIFT-F1 to SHIFT-F8 = Hotkeys for the second row of applications.
 ALT-F1 to ALT-F8     = Hotkeys for the third row of applications.

                  Picture the following in your mind:

                    | F1  F2  F3  F4  F5  F6  F7  F8
             -------|----------------------------------
             CTRL   |  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
             SHIFT  |  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16
             ALT    | 17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24


 The numbers 1-24 are the 24 currently shown applications. When you
change the page (PGUP/PGDN) the hotkeys become available to the
newly displayed applications. Pressing any of these key combinations
will launch an application.


 ****************** USER DEFINED (YOUR OWN) HOTKEYS *****************

 Assigning hotkeys to your applications, is the same procedure as in
the System Manager. Just precede the key you wish to assign, with the
ampersand character '&' in the application's name. For example,

   Fli&ght Sim  < The 'g' character is the hotkey.
   &Vertical    < The 'v' character is the hotkey.

   * HDM is case-insensitive to the hotkey assignments.

 Up to 24 hotkeys can be assigned, and this from A-Z. You can't
use any other characters, including numbers as hotkeys. If you
assign the same hotkey to more then one application, only the
last application will respond to the hotkey.

 To launch an application using one of your hotkeys, just press
the corresponding key, A-Z.


 ****************** APPLICATION MANAGEMENT *********************

 a) ADDING A NEW APPLICATION.
 -----------------------------

  A DOS application can be any .EXE, .COM or .BAT (batch)
file. DO NOT use .EXM files as applications! You are not
obligated to use extensions, but it is recommended.

 If the Icon (*.ICN) has the same name as the application,
and resides in the same directory as the application, it
will be displayed first when the icon browser pops up.
If not, the built-in browser will let you browse all
the icons in your icon directory. You must specify
to HDM where your icon directory resides:

 Go into [MENU][Setup][Icon dir]  and enter the path of
your icon directory. For example, if your icons reside in
the a:\icons directory, enter the following:

    a:\icons

 If no icon is found, or you pressed the ESC key while
browsing, the default [hp] graphical icon will be
displayed instead. Once the icon has been found, HDM
no longer needs it, since it stores it in the DOSMGR.DAT
file.

  Ok, now let's add an application:

  You can add a new DOS application by pressing F2, or
[MENU][Application][Add]. By pressing F2, an entry screen
will 'pop-up' waiting for the following input:


 NAME = The name of the application (not the filename). It
        will be splitted in 2 equal lines when displayed,
        of 7 characters each. Use spaces to center it with
        the icon on the screen. The name will be displayed
        under the application's icon. It's in this entry
        field that you can specify the application hotkey.
        Just precede the hotkey character in the name, with
        the ampersand symbol '&'.


 PATH = The path and filename of the application.

                 example:

                 a:\utility\q.exe


 COMMAND TAIL= The command line arguments (if any) of your
               application. You can also specify other
               arguments before launching an application
               by pressing F6.

 HELP=         Here you can attach a small help message (tip)
               that will be displayed every time you launch
               the application (provided that the Enable Help
               checkbox is checked).


 ZOOM MODE   = The zoom mode that the application will run:
               Small 80x25, medium 64x18 or large 40x16.

 B&W MODE    = Sets the palmtop's display in B&W mode.

 INVERT      = Inverts the colors (negative picture) before
               launching the application. Same effect as the
               [ON/] key combination.

 DITHER      = Same effect as the [ON*] key combination,
               which is used to select between 2 display
               dithering settings.


 * NOTE: Some screen settings may appear as if they don't
         have any affect when launching an application.
         This is because an application may switch to
         another video or graphics mode, and the settings
         won't take affect. These settings are effective
         with non-graphics applications.


 PAUSE       = specifies if the application should wait for
               a key press before returning to HDM.
               If enabled, you will be prompted 'Press any key
               to return to HDM' before the application
               actually returns to HDM. Use the space-bar
               to toggle it on/off.

 SERIAL PORT = specifies if HDM should enable the serial
               port before launching the application.
               Use the space-bar to toggle on/off.
               The serial port will be closed upon return
               to HDM.

 OPEN WITH ARGUMENTS:
               when enabling this option HDM will prompt you
               with a window just before launching the
               application, so you can enter additional
               command-line arguments. Pressing F8 when you
               are asked for arguments will open up a file
               browser. Every time you press F8 and select
               a file, it will be appended to the argument
               list.



 b) Notes on editing an application entry.
 -----------------------------------------

  If you don't enter a name for the application, the application
won't be edited. Press F10 to accept the changes, F9 to cancel.
When editing an application entry, you will be prompted if you
wish to change its icon.


 c) DELETING AN APPLICATION.
 ----------------------------

  You will be prompted if you really want to delete the selected
application. Hit F10 to delete, or F9 / ESC to abort. Note
that the actual application is not deleted from your disk, but
rather removed from the application list.


 d) OPEN (execute) AN APPLICATION.
 ----------------------------------

  You can either press F5 or ENTER on the selected application
to open it. The selected application will be launched with
the defined parameters. HDM will also change to the
specified drive and directory of the application.

 You can also use the hotkey combinations described earlier
to launch any of the currently displayed applications.

  If the application is not found, an error message will be
displayed. You must have enough memory to run the application,
otherwise a 'not enough memory' error will be displayed.

  Pressing F6 instead of F5, will ask for new command line
parameters before launching the application. If you do not
enter any parameters, a file selection box will appear to let
you select a file as a parameter.

  Please note that if you run HDM from within System Manager,
the more applications that are open (such as memo, note-taker,
etc..) the less memory you will have available to launch a
DOS application with HDM. Close down as many applications
as possible to release as much memory needed to launch your
DOS application. You can press the SPACE-BAR while in HDM
to see the amount of free memory available.



The following batch file is equivalent to DM.EXE:

                @rem HDM starter.
                @echo off
                :lp
                hdm ~ %1
                if errorlevel 99 goto quit
                goto lp
                :quit
