 DBView 2.0: HP200LX Database viewer                [HK:10/96]
----------------------------------------------------------------

 DBView is a database viewer for GDB/NDB/PDB database
files, having the same look & feel as the built-in
database application. It can also perform simple statistical
calculations on selected fields with given criteria.

The differences between DBView and the System Manager's DB
application are:


 * DBView can run in DOS,

 * Has better searching capabilities with AND/OR operators,
   speed-locate & find "Only" features.

 * Opens database files for read-only, extending battery
   life when viewing database files stored in a flashcard.
   This also prevents possible file corruption.

 * Performs simple statistical calculations: SUM, AVG, MIN
   & MAX  on specified fields with given criteria.

 * When used with HDM (a DOS application manager), it enables
   you to load & view any of your database files with a press of
   a single button. Please read document below for more details.

 * You can specify a search string directly at the DOS prompt
   when launching DBV.

 * DBView can be used on your desktop computer by using the
   INT5F HP200LX Graphics emulator (included in this ZIP).


 New in this version:
 --------------------

 + Added SUM, MIN, MAX, AVG computing capabilities.
 + Added field extraction feature.
 + Added horizontal lines option.
 + Implemented Right-Justify option for list-view.
 + Added HOME key when viewing notes.

 + Fixed bug when speed-locating strings containing commas.
 + Fixed list-view column overlapping.
 + Fixed a few other display glitches.
 + Fixed Note (PGDN) bug.

 + Included INT5F graphics driver to enable the use
   of DBView on a desktop computer.


 _______________
 I. Installation

 There are 5 files included in this archive:

 + DBV.DOC:   The DBView documentation.
 + DBV.EXE:   The DBView program.
 + DBV.CFG:   The DBView configuration file.
 + DBV.ICN:   The DBView icon.

 + INT5F.ZIP: Graphics emulator to enable you to run DBView
              on your desktop. Documentation for it is
              available in INT5F.ZIP


 DBView is a YAPA (Yet Another PAL Application<g>), and like
all PAL applications, it's a DOS program. Simply copy the
files of the archive in a directory of your choice. The
configuration file DBV.CFG must always reside in the same
directory as DBV.EXE.


 NOTE: DBV requires at least 130k of memory to operate.
       If you install DBV in System Manager, please remember
       to add '|130' at the end of the name. For example,
       if DBV is installed in A:\DBV, the System manager
       entry will look like this:

           a:\dbv\dbv.exe|130

       The '|130' will reserve 130k of memory for DBV. For
       more details on installing applications in System
       manager please consult your HP200LX owner's manual.


 You can also specify database filenames if you would like
to have several System Manager DBV entries (one for each
database file for example):

           a:\dbv\dbv.exe myfile.gdb|130



 Configuration:
 --------------

 DBV.CFG is the configuration file of DBView. You can use
it to change some of the default parameters of DBView. At this
moment, DBV.CFG is divided into 3 sections, [options], [paths]
& [files]:


[options]
; Set to 1 to enable error beeps, 0 to disable them.
beep=1
; Set to 1 to enable search in note fields.
SearchNotes=0
; Set to 1 to enable horizontal lines separating records.
HorizLines=0
; Set to 1 to display numbers right-justified in list-view.
RightJustify=0

[paths]
; set your database directory
dbdir=c:\_dat

[files]
; filename of dump/extraction file
DumpFile=dbv.sav


 You can add comments anywhere in DBV.CFG provided that you
start the lines with a semicolon.

 NOTE: Normally DBV.CFG should be located in the same
       directory as DBV.EXE. However, you can make DBV
       find DBV.CFG from any directory, by just copying
       DBV.CFG into the C:\_DAT directory.


 There's also an icon provided in this archive if you wish to
install DBView in the System Manager.


_____________________
II.Program operation.

 You probably know how to use the System Manager's database
application to create & view database files. DBView works
very similar for viewing them.

 DBView supports multiple card database files. These are
database files having more then 1 page of record information
(up to 4 max.). DBView will display the page number on the
top status line. Pressing the PGUP/PGDN keys will enable you
to view the other pages, when available.

 * DBView cannot view password protected database files!
   (will display Error#24 if file is password protected).


 To run DBView from the DOS prompt simply type dbv <ENTER>.
You may include a database filename at the command line if
you wish, and DBView will run & load the specified database
file. The command line arguments are:

  dbv <dbfile> <search string>

 where <dbvfile> is the name of a valid GDB, NDB or PDB file.
If no extension is given, .GDB is taken as the default. You
can also (optionally) specify a search string. DBV will launch
and search for that string if you specify one.

IMPORTANT: Software Carousel(tm) users may switch into a
           DOS session, leaving the System Manager's database
           application open. You can not load a database
           file that is currently open by the SysMgr's DB
           application. The following error message will be
           displayed and DBV will quit if you attempt to do so:

                 "Database file not closed?"

 If the DATABASE application is open and using the file you
wish to load in DBV, you must close the DATABASE application,
and then use DBView to view it. You may also get this message
if the DATABASE application hasn't closed the database file
properly (when this happens the lookup table is missing in
the file). To correct this, you must open the database file
using the DATABASE application, and then close it by quitting
DATABASE. This will do the necessary cleanup in the database
file.

   *** Now here's a solution to avoid the above problems:
   ------------------------------------------------------
   Since backups are always a good idea, why not use DBView on
   your backup database files, and System manager's DB on the
   original ones (when editing is needed).


 DBView has 2 display modes: List view and record view. You
can use the UP/DOWN arrows to select a record. To see the
contents of a record press ENTER or F2. Most of the DBV
functions can be accessed from the function keys. Some
of the functions can also be accessed by the menus (please
note that menus work only in list-view mode).

Here's the description of the function keys for the list-view
mode:


 ARROWS:  The Up key browses into the database backwards.
          The Down key browses forward. The current
          record is displayed on the top status bar along
          with the loaded database filename.

 HOME:    Select the first record of the database.
 END:     Select the last record of the database.

 F1:      Simple help screen.
 F2:      Same as ENTER, displays the selected record data.

 F3:      Full screen note. The record's note (if any) will
          be displayed in full.


     NOTE: The current version of DBView still has a limited
           way on viewing the complete note of a record.
           (a multi-line field requires a lot of code<g>).
           You can press the F3 key [more] to view the
           rest of a large note. [HOME] or F4 will bring
           you at the beginning of the note.


 F4: Find feature. The find dialog will popup waiting for
     the following input:

     String1: String of text/numbers you wish to find in the
              database file.

     String2: Optional, second search string. If used, you
              must select the searching method (logic):

         AND: Searches for a match of both String1 & String2
         OR:  Searches for a match of either String1 or String2


         [x]: The 'include notes' checkbox toggles the search
              mode to include notes while searching (slower).


        NOTE: Hold down the ESC key to abort the search. DBView
              will search only through the records of the
              currently selected subset (all records by
              default).

     If a match is found, DBView will highlite the record. You
     can then press ENTER to see its contents.

 F5: Will search for the next match, and display it if found.

 F6: Find "Only" feature. This search option will create
     a subset of all matching records. You can return to
     the previous subset by pressing F7, or even create
     other subsets from the matching results by pressing
     F6 as many times as you like.

 F7: Change to a different subset of the database. The
     default is 'all database items'.  Note that this will
     affect the search, since it will search only through
     the records of the selected subset.

     NOTE: There may be ocassions where some subsets will not
           appear in the subset selection window. This is
           because the subset indexes are missing from the
           database file. By simply opening the database
           file with System Manager's database application
           and viewing the 'missing' subsets, the file will
           be updated and the missing subsets should then
           appear in DBView's subset selection window.


 F8: Dump the current record to a file (filename specified
     in DBV.CFG) in ASCII (text) format.


 F9: Open database. You can use this option to load another
     database file into DBView.


 There are some DBView features that can only be accessed
by the menus. These include database calculations (explained
further below), and field extraction.

 MENU->Database->Extract field data:

This feature can be used to extract the data from all the records,
of a selected field into the DBV.SAV file. DBView will ask you
for the field you wish to extract, and then extract it in ASCII
format. You can only extract fields that contain numeric or text
data (checkboxes and radio buttons cannot be extracted<g>.)
Note that if DBV.SAV already exists, it will be over-written,
not appended.


 PRESSING ANY OTHER KEY:

  Pressing any alphanumerical key activates the SPEED-LOCATE
  feature. A small window will popup at the top of the screen,
  and every keystroke you enter will appear in that window.
  DBV will search for a match while you are typing. If no
  match can be found a short beep will be heard. Please note
  that the speed locate feature searches only through the
  items of the first (left) column of the list view display.
  (same as System Manager's database application).


 Now in the record-view mode (F2), the following keys are active:

 F1:        Small help screen.
 F2/ESC:    Back to list view display mode.
 F3:        View the record note (if any) in full screen.
 F4:        Search for 1 or 2 strings in database (see above).
 F5:        Find next match (see above).
 F6/UP:     Select the previous record in the list.
 F7/DOWN:   Select the next record in the list.
 PGUP/PGDN: Select the page to view in a multiple-card database.



___________________________________
III. DBView COMPUTING CAPABILITIES.

DBView has a small set of 4 statistical calculations that can
be performed on a selected field, with given criteria. These
features are only accessible from within the menus:


 a) Set Criteria
 ---------------

If you don't use this option, DBView will perform the
selected calculation on ALL database records of the CURRENT
SUBSET. You can provide the following criteria if you want
DBView to do the calculation based on records that only match
the criteria you have entered.

 The criteria is based on 3 values: First, the field that
will be used to compare the criteria against. Then, you
must provide one of the 10 relational operators (comparison
between field & criteria). Finally, the criteria data that
will be compared against the selected field using the
selected relational operator. Here's the list of the possible
relational operators:

 NOP: No criteria - process all records.

 String operators:

  = : Field must match the given criteria.
      ATTENTION: criteria string is CASE-SENSITIVE!

 ~= : Criteria must match at least a PART of the field.
      ATTENTION: criteria string is CASE-SENSITIVE!

 Numeric operators:

 <> : Field must not match given criteria.
  < : Field numeric value must be smaller then criteria value.
 <= : Field numeric value must be smaller or equal to criteria.
  > : Field numeric value must be greater then criteria value.
 >= : Field numeric value must be greater or equal to criteria.

 Boolean operators:

 ON : Checkbox or Radio button must be enabled (marked).
 OFF: Checkbox or Radio button must be disabled (unmarked).


 b) Calculations:
 ----------------

 All calculations will be performed on the current subset,
and only with records that match the given criteria (or
all records if no criteria are given).

 SUM: Adds numeric data of the specified field and displays
      the total.

 AVG: Computes the average (SUM/n) of the specified field.
 MIN: Find the MINimum (smallest) value of the specified field.
 MAX: Find the MAXimum (largest) value of the specified field.



 NOTES:
 ------
 >, >=, <, <= operators can only be used with numeric values.
 ON, OFF operators must only be used with checkbox or radio
 button types of fields.

 DBView assumes that strings having the "hh:mm" format contains
 time data, so it computes & shows the result in the same format.

 DBView does not compute dates.

APPENDIX

 INT5F.ZIP:
 ----------

 This file is included in this archive. It's a small TSR
 which simulates the HP200LX graphics on desktop computers.
 If you would like to use DBView on your desktop system,
 please pkunzip this file and read the included documentation.
 You can also use other PAL applications such as PalEdit
 and HV with INT5F on your desktop.


 ERROR CODES:
 ------------

 Here are listed a few usefull error codes that DBV may return:

 Error #2 : Out of memory (may also display 'PALMEM fail: out of memory').
 Error #4 : File read operation error (file corrupted?).
 Error #5 : Index is missing from database file, must be refreshed
            by System Manager's database application.

 Error #7 : Not a database file.
 Error #8 : World time database file - not supported.
 Error #9 : Appointment book database file - not supported.
 Error #14: Error opening database file (file not found?).
 Error #24: Database file is password protected.


 * If you get unexpected errors when using DBView within
   System Manager, try to increase the amount of memory
   on the application entry screen.


 HDM USERS:
 ----------

 If you're using HDM, a DOS application manager written for
the HP200LX palmtops (and also a PAL application) you can
use it to display several database files in the icon screen,
and open a database file by simply selecting its icon. In
order for this to work, you must enter 'dbv <dbfile>' as
DOS application names. Here's an example:

 Press F2 in HDM and the 'New application' screen will appear.
Enter the following in the entry fields:

 APPLICATION NAME: Phonebook
 PATH & FILENAME : a:\dbv\dbv
 COMMAND TAIL    : c:\_dat\phone.pdb

 Ofcourse, the 'PATH & FILENAME' line above assumes that DBView
resides in a:\dbv directory, and your phone.pdb file in
c:\_dat. You will need to enter your own paths in there.

 Now this new entry in HDM will enable you to load & view your
phonebook database with a press of a button. You can add as
many entries like this one as you wish, one for each database
file, and startup DBView with the selected database with
a single keystroke.

Credits

 I would like to thank all the PAL contributors for providing
the PAL library, specially Gilles Kohl, and Fred Kaufman
for giving me the idea of this program. I would also like
to thank ALL of you for your suggestions on improving DBV.


 DBView is a freeware PAL application. DBView, like any program,
may have bugs. Although I have tested DBView and use it with
my own database files, I cannot guaranty that it's full-proof.
so "use it at your own risk"! You can send me bug reports &
comments at:

   TODO list:
   ----------

 Sorry if some of your suggestions didn't make it in this
version. There are *many* things I would like to add and
improve in DBView, but unfortunately the memory requirements
won't allow me to do so. DBView now needs at least 130k to
run, and soon, if we add more stuff, we won't be able to use
it within System Manager.

So future releases would probably be only bug fixes, and
maybe some minor additions or enhancements.
