
This small set of GDB database access functions was written during the
development of DBView. They are written to work in conjuction with
the PAL development kit (as an add-on). They permit easy read-only
access of GDB/PDB database files. I decided to release what I currently
have, if it can be of any help or interest to anyone to use. Please note
that I have only tested them with the Borland TC & MIC PowerC
compilers.


INSTALLATION PROCEDURE:
-----------------------

1. Add the following line into the PAL.H header file, located at
   the ../SRC/INC subdirectory of your PAL tree:

   #include "palgdb.h"

2. Copy the PALGDB.H file (included in this archive) into
   the same (../SRC/INC) directory as PAL.H.

3. The next step is to add the following lines into your SRCLIST file
   located into ../PAL/SRC subdirectory:

        gdb\closedb.c
        gdb\getfield.c
        gdb\opendb.c
        gdb\readrec.c
        gdb\searchdb.c
        gdb\showrec.c
        gdb\showcard.c
        gdb\chgvpnt.c
        gdb\linkdef.c

4. And finally, rebuilt your PAL library files by running PM from the
   ../PAL/SRC subdirectory.


ADDITIONAL NOTES:
-----------------

The SAMPLES.ZIP file contains 2 small database utilities which
demonstrate the use of the functions. The PALGDB.DOC file
explains in detail every function.
