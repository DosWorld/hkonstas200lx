INT5fh Vr.1.01: HP200LX Graphics driver for PAL applications
------------------------------------------------------------


History:
--------

Vr.1.01 08/08/1997: Bug fixes and speed optimization.

Vr.1.00 09/10/1996: Initial release.


NOTE: Due to the release of PALRUN, this will be the last
      update to INT5F. Palrun, unlike INT5F, is not a TSR,
      and is easier to use. You can download PalRun (and
      check for updates) at the following site:

- What is INT5f?
----------------

It's a small TSR (resident program) that enables most
PAL written applications for the HP100/200LX palmtops
to be used on your desktop. It does that by emulating
the graphics of the HP palmtop.

INT5F can run on any IBM compatible computer, using any
cpu (8088->Pentium), and a CGA or VGA display. 486
(or pentium) is recommended for faster screen output,
since all the graphics are emulated by software.

HV, the famous HTML viewer for the HP100/200LX palmtops
(written by Andreas Garzotto) is one of the many PAL
applications that can now be used on the desktop. PalEdit,
and DBView have also been successfully tested on the
desktop using INT5F.

When used in VGA mode, future PAL applications will take
advantage of this mode and display more information
(vertically) on the screen.


- How do I use it?
------------------

The easiest way is to simply run INT5f /c and then
your PAL application (e.g: HV.EXE). When you
quit your application, run INT5f /u so it unloads
itself from the memory. The best thing to do is to
create a small batch file that does this automatically:

 int5f /c
 hv.exe
 int5f /u

There are a few command-line parameters available with
INT5f to launch it in different video modes. Type INT5F
with no arguments to see the following help screen:

HP200LX INT5fh CGA Graphics driver for PAL applications.
Vr.1.0 (09/96). Freeware by Harry Konstas.

 USAGE: int5f [switches]  ex: int5f /c

  Command line switches:
   /v = Install in VGA mode.
   /c = Install in CGA mode (default).
   /r = Install in reverse VGA mode.
   /i = Install in inverse CGA mode.
   /u = Uninstall INT5F driver from memory.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

INT5f /v launces INT5f in VGA mode. Some PAL applications now
auto-detect this mode and use the display accordingly. The
/r and /i switches are used to invert the display output
(black on white background instead of white on black).

Future releases of INT5F will have the ability to load
external FCL fonts (using Gilles kohl's famous font loader
for the HP palmtops) or .HFN font files.

A word of CAUTION: There maybe some PAL applications which
are using special 'hardware' calls on the palmtop. Such
applications may lock-up your system. Typical PAL applications
such as HV, DBView & PalEdit are using only the palmtop's
graphics calls, and are safe to use with INT5f on your
desktop.



ACCESSING PAL APPLICATION MENUS:
--------------------------------

This really depends on the author of the PAL application.
Currently, most PAL applications use CTRL-M, or ALT-F10 to
activate the menus from the desktop.



Programmer's corner:
--------------------

INT5F is a TSR emulating the INT5fh services of the palmtop,
on the desktop. In this version, it takes up about 20k of
RAM. Most of the memory is used by the 3 font bitmaps.

All INT5f calls are supported except video mode 0x20
(HP95LX). See GRAPH.DOC in the HP Developer's package
for more information.

 * The 3 HFN fonts that are included in this archive are
   not the original HP200LX fonts - I have created a new
   set by modifying the original fonts.
