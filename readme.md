## INT5F

INT5F.COM - It's a small TSR (resident program) that enables most
PAL written applications for the HP100/200LX palmtops
to be used on your desktop. It does that by emulating
the graphics of the HP palmtop.

INT5F can run on any IBM compatible computer, using any
cpu (8088->Pentium), and a CGA or VGA display. 486
(or pentium) is recommended for faster screen output,
since all the graphics are emulated by software.

## HDM

HDM240 - HDM is a DOS application manager which has the same
graphical user interface as the built-in Application
Manager of the HP200LX. HDM can also run in DOS, and can
handle up to 120 applications.

## P.A.L  (Palmtop Application Library) Tools

P.A.L. is a Library of C functions that gives DOS programs the look & feel
of the built-in applications of the HP100/200LX. PAL was originally
suggested as a common development effort by CompuServe's HPHAND sysop
Mark Scardina, and the project leader is Gilles Kohl.

In this archive you will also find the source code for some of the
utilities I have written using the PAL library, the Pal Font Editor
(PFE) and the Pal Dialog Editor, PDE.

## DBV

DBView is a database viewer for GDB/NDB/PDB database
files, having the same look & feel as the built-in
database application.

## CheckLOG

CheckLOG - is a checkbook management application designed for
the HP100LX palmtop.
