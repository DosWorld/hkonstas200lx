1.INTRODUCTION


 CheckLOG is a checkbook management application designed for
the HP100LX palmtop. You can manage all your accounts, with
this easy to use program. CheckLOG was written entirely
in Assembly Language which makes it very compact and fast.

 CheckLOG has the 'look & feel' of the built-in HP100LX
applications so it's a nice addition to the Program Manager.
Best of all, it's Freeware!


This version (3.4) has the following enhancements & corrections:

a) Global protection. You can now lock the account so you
   don't change something by mistake. You must unlock it
   in order to do any modifications.

b) Fixed the bug that was automatically reconciling a transaction
   when editing.

c) All transactions are now NOT reconciled by default.

d) CheckLOG now brings you automatically to the last transaction
   when you run the program.

e) Replaced the Note field with the Name field in the .PRN file
   creation.

f) Quick-Unlock feature by just pressing SPACE-BAR followed by
   the 'U' key.


                              * * *



  Here's what's included in the CHKLOG.ZIP file:

        CHKLOG.COM      The program itself
        CHKLOG.CDB      Sample database (account)
        CHKLOG.ICN      Small icon for the program manager.
        CHKLOG.DOC      This DOC file you're reading.

  The program will also create CHKLOG.ENV (enviroment file)
 in your C:\_DAT directory when executed.

  The program can also create a comma-delimited file called
 CHKLOG.LST which can be imported into LOTUS 123.
 It can also create a CHKLOG.PRN file for printing.

  You don't need any special setup to use this program. You
 can put it in a flashcard if you wish, but it's much faster
 on the drive C: or ramcard. After you installed the program
 and you've checked it with the sample database, just erase
 CHKLOG.CDB, then run the program again to create your
 account database. When you create your account for the
 first time, just 'DEPOSIT' the current balance of your
 account to the database. You can also create your account
 by just typing chklog <filename>, where <filename> is the
 name of your account.

___________________
2.PROGRAM OPERATION

  You can run CheckLOG like any other .COM program, from DOS
 or from the program manager. You may also use the CHKLOG.ICN
 icon if you run it from the program manager. See your 100LX
 instruction book for more information on how to add an icon
 to an application.

  You can specify the database filename at the command line
 when you run CheckLOG. The command line argument is as follows:

 chklog <filename>          ( from the DOS prompt )

 Example:

 c:\>chklog myfile.cdb

  In this example, CheckLOG will load and run 'myfile.cdb'
 as an account database. Like that you can run the program
 with the account database of your choice. When a filename
 is specified at the command line, it becomes the default
 filename of CheckLOG and it will be loaded the next time
 you run the program, even if you don't specify it at the
 command line anymore. If the file isn't found or doesn't
 exist, it will be created.

  It's a good idea to have meaningfull names for accound
 databases. Here are some examples:

 c:\>chklog visa        ( run checkLOG with VISA account)
 c:\>chklog savings     ( run checkLOG with SAVINGS account )
 c:\>chklog checking    ( run checkLOG with CHECKING account )

  Remember that the filenames you will be using must not exceed
 8 characters. You can include an extension such as .CDB if
 you like.

  Before erasing the sample database (account) try the program
 with it so you can learn to navigate through the program.
 CheckLOG has the 'feel' of the built-in Database application
 of the HP100LX. Use the arrows UP/DOWN to browse through the
 account. Pressing TAB will display all the information
 about the current high-lighted item. Pressing TAB in the entry
 window will cycle through the input fields. The SPACE-BAR is
 used for tagging/untagging the transactions.

  On the right of the top line you can see the account name
 (filename). You can use filenames  such as 'checking' or
 'visa'. I used CHKLOG.CDB as an example. CheckLOG saves
 the complete path & filename to the CHKLOG.ENV file. The
 path+filename is limited to only 40 characters. I keep
 the program on a flashcard on drive A: and the database files
 in the C:\_DAT directory for faster operation.

  CheckLOG takes its currency symbol from the System Manager
 file, SETUP.ENV located in the c:\_dat directory. Just go
 to the Setup Menu in the System Manager, and select your
 currency symbol (2 characters only) in the international option.


  Here's a brief summary of the function keys:

 F1  = Small Help screen.
 F2  = Write a check. This takes $$$ out of your account. You
       can enter a check # if you wish, but it's optional.
       All check entries ARE NOT reconciled by default, since
       the amount is taken out of your account on a later date.

 F3  = Deposit $$$ to your account.
 F4  = Withdrawal an amount from the current account, or
       ATM (automatic teller machine withdrawal)

 F5  = Transfer an amount to another account.
       (same as withdrawal)

 F6  = Bank's service charges.
 F7  = Adds Bank's interest amount to your account.
 F8  = View your current Balance.It also displays the
       reconciled TOTAL of all the transactions marked
       with the 'diamond' symbol, using the SPACE-BAR.

 F9  = Page UP for browsing. You can also use PGUP key.
 F10 = Page DOWN for browsing. You can also use PGDN key.

 ESC = Quits the program.

  V  = View option. Toggles transaction column display to
       NOTE, NAME & TYPE fields.

 DEL = Cancels the high-lighted transaction. The transaction
       remains in the database but it is marked as 'CANCELLED'
       and it is not calculated in the balance. It automaticly
       balances the transaction history. The transaction
       remains in the database for future reference.

ENTER= Edits the high-lighted transaction. It automatically
       balances the transaction history. If an invalid date
       is entered, the current date will be written. In order
       for the entered date to be accepted, you must press
       F10 when finished editing.

       Note: ENTER will react like the TAB key when the
             account is locked. You MUST unlock the account
             in order to be able to edit a transaction.

  INS= Same as pressing 'I'.This let's you insert a new
       transaction between two transactions. The new
       transaction will be Inserted ABOVE the current
       highlighted transaction. The date will be the same
       as the highlighted item date, but you can change it
       if you wish.

SPACE= Tag / untag a transaction. This reconciles ANY entry.
       The small diamond on the left of each entry tells you
       that the transaction is reconciled. Pressing SPACE toggles
       the state of the transaction.

       Note: The Tagging function will NOT work if the account
             is locked. You MUST unlock the account in order
             to be able to tag/untag transactions. A message
             will appear on the screen to tell you when you
             try to tag/untag a transaction when the account
             is locked, and asks you if you want to unlock it
             by pressing the 'U' key. The account is ALWAYS
             locked by default when you run the program.


 TAB = View information about the current high-lighted
       transaction. Same as ENTER when the account is locked.


                       MENU OPERATIONS:
                       ----------------

 MENU or ALT opens the menu bar for the following operations:


 ACCOUNT
 -------

 OPEN ANOTHER ACCOUNT: Open another (existing) account. Just
                       enter the filename.

 CREATE NEW ACCOUNT  : Create a new account. Just enter the
                       filename. When opening a new account
                       just 'DEPOSIT' the current balance
                       of the new account.

 CREATE .LST FILE    : Creates CHKLOG.LST which can be imported
                       into LOTUS 123. When in LOTUS use the
                       'File, Import, Numbers' to import the
                       file CHKLOG.LST into the worksheet.Do
                       not forget to adjust the columns of
                       123 accordingly.

 CREATE .PRN FILE    : Creates CHKLOG.PRN for printing. Just
                       type  'type chklog.prn >prn'  at the
                       dos prompt to print it. Don't forget
                       to turn on the serial port of the HP100LX
                       ( serctl/w ).

 LOCK ACCOUNT        : This function locks (protects) your
                       transactions by accidental modifications.
                       When the account is locked, you won't be
                       able to modify any transaction, but you
                       are still able to enter new transactions.
                       The account is always locked by default
                       when you run the program.


 UNLOCK ACCOUNT      : This function unlocks the account so you
                       can do any modifications on the recorded
                       transactions. The account will remain
                       unlocked for the current session and
                       lock itself again the next time you run
                       the program. You can lock the account
                       from within the program if you wish by
                       using the LOCK ACCOUNT function. You
                       can also unlock the account by pressing
                       the 'U' key when asked by CheckLOG.

 *Quick-Unlock*      : Press the SPACE-BAR followed by the 'U'
                       key. It is much faster than going through
                       the menu.


 TRANSACTION:  The items in this window have the same functions
 ------------  as the F2-F7,I, DEL & ENTER function keys.



 SEARCH:
 -------
 CHECK #    : Search for a check number. If found, all the
              information of that transaction will be displayed.
 AMOUNT $   : Search for a transaction amount. If found all the
              information of that transaction will be displayed.

  * NOTE > The search function won't work if you have less
           than 13 transactions in the account. (1 page).



 QUIT:  Quits the program

                              transaction takes 60 bytes of
                              disk space.

4.SPECIAL NOTES


 * Exceeding the balance limits (-2,000,000 > +7,999,999.99)
   will display wrong values but won't affect program operation.
   In other words, this program is not written for VERY rich or
   VERY poor people!

 * Exceeding the maximum transaction limit, the program will
   ignore the 'extra' most significant digits. People who
   win a lottery ticket of more than $999,999.99 will have
   to enter this amount doing 2 deposits.

 * Entering an invalid date will default to current date. You
   must press F10 when you complete editing a date in order
   to change the date. Pressing Enter will keep the default
   date.
        
 * The program will BEEP when it displays a negative balance
   to catch your attention.

 * Since the database file is growing bigger & bigger with
   every transaction, it's a good idea to copy it to another
   'archive' filename and restart again the account by doing
   a 'DEPOSIT' of its current balance. You can do that when
   you feel that your database file is to large and it takes
   too much time to edit a transaction.

 * If you ever get a 'Corrupted .CDB (database) file' error,
   it means that : a) Your database is somehow corrupted, or
   b) you loaded a non-CheckLOG database format file into
   CheckLOG. To be able to run the program again, just delete
   the CHKLOG.ENV in the C:\_DAT directory because it holds the
   name of the last file used. You can also delete or rename the
   corrupted database.

 * You can PKLITE(tm) the CHKLOG.COM file so it will take less
   disk space. When Pklited, it takes about 10k of disk space.

5.ABOUT THE PROGRAM


  CheckLOG was written on a 2MB HP100LX and it has 6005 lines
 of assembly language (8088 code). It will ONLY work in a
 HP100LX. Trying to run it on a PC will give an error message.

  This program is freeware and comes with no warranties, it
 is given away as-is. I can not be held responsible for any
 possible data-loss when using this program.
        
  I know that I said many times that 'this should be the final
 version of CheckLOG', but as you've just seen, here's another
 one. But like I said before, since I never expected to go this
 far with this program, and never imagined it would have all
 these functions, the structure of the program has become a
 huge 'spaggetti' from all the 'patching' I've done by adding
 these functions. Also, the program is quite big, around 115
 pages when printed, and difficult to work with because of
 the patched structure. There will probably be other versions
 but nothing major, only minor improvements. So I leave you
 now with this version 3.4 for the moment, but I'm still
 listening for any comments or ideas that you might have.



 Special Thanks:

 1) All of the people who are using this program and gave
    me many suggestions on enhancing CheckLOG.

 2) Everett Kaser for uploading the graphic functions
    information of the HP100LX on the HPHAND forum,

 3) Fred Kaufman for his Beta-testing & great suggestions
    for this program.

 4) Richard Rae, David C.Diemer and Iver Erling Aarva from
    the HPHAND forum of CompuServe for their suggestions,
    testing, and ideas on making CheckLOG better to use.
    Thank you guys! I had lot's of fun writing it!
